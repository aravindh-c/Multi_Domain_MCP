## 🧪 LAB HISTORY – KEY FINDINGS (Trend-based)

### 1️⃣ **Blood Sugar / Diabetes**

* **Pattern**: Prediabetes → early diabetes → improved control
* **HbA1c**:

  * Aug 2025: **7.2%** (Diabetic range)
  * Sep 2025: **6.5%**
  * Dec 2025: **6.1%** (Prediabetic range)
* **FBS**: Improved to normal range (≈ 88–96 mg/dL)
* **PPBS**: Variable, spikes with diet lapses

**Interpretation**

* Insulin resistance present
* Responds well to diet + metformin
* Not insulin-dependent

---

### 2️⃣ **Cholesterol / Lipids**

* **LDL**:

  * Aug 2025: **187 mg/dL (High)**
  * Sep 2025: **126 mg/dL (Improved on statin)**
  * Dec 2025: **149 mg/dL (Rebound after stopping statin)**
* **HDL**: Low-normal (31–41 mg/dL)
* **Triglycerides**: Borderline → improved
* **Non-HDL cholesterol**: Elevated when statin stopped

**Interpretation**

* Dyslipidemia, statin-responsive
* LDL rises quickly without medication

---

### 3️⃣ **Uric Acid**

* Aug 2025: **8.3 mg/dL**
* Sep 2025: **10.2 mg/dL (High)**
* Dec 2025: **8.3 mg/dL (Still high)**

**Interpretation**

* Chronic hyperuricemia
* High risk due to past kidney stone
* Needs hydration + diet + medication

---

### 4️⃣ **Kidney Health**

* **History**: Left kidney stone surgery (past)
* **Creatinine**: Normal (0.8–1.0 mg/dL)
* **eGFR**: Normal (>90)
* **Urine analysis**: Normal, no blood/protein

**Interpretation**

* Kidney function currently normal
* Previous stone side occasionally sensitive
* Stone prevention is priority

---

### 5️⃣ **Liver (Fatty Liver)**

* Aug 2025 USG: **Grade I fatty liver**
* LFTs: AST/ALT/GGT **normal to mildly elevated**, later normalized

**Interpretation**

* Reversible fatty liver
* Diet and weight sensitive

---

### 6️⃣ **Vitamin Status**

* **Vitamin D**:

  * Aug 2025: **9.5 ng/mL (Severe deficiency)**
  * Dec 2025: **21.8 ng/mL (Insufficient)**
* **Vitamin B12**:

  * Aug 2025: ~320 pg/mL
  * Dec 2025: **141 pg/mL (Deficient)**

**Interpretation**

* Vitamin D improving but not optimal
* B12 deficiency likely due to:

  * Metformin use
  * Functional absorption inefficiency (not structural gut disease)

---

## 💊 MEDICATION HISTORY

### ✅ **Currently Taking**

* **Metformin**

  * Purpose: Blood sugar control
* **Statin (cholesterol-lowering)**

  * Purpose: LDL reduction
* **Uric acid–lowering medication**

  * Purpose: Prevent gout/kidney stones
* **Nervijen (Methylcobalamin)**

  * Purpose: Vitamin B12 deficiency correction

### ❌ **Not Taking**

* Insulin
* Neuropathic pain drugs (Pregabalin / NP combos)
* Homeopathy (ignored as requested)

## 🍽️ DIETARY GUIDANCE (FOR RAG ANSWERS)

### 🟢 **OK / GOOD FOODS (Preferred)**

* Eggs (3 whole + whites)
* Low-fat paneer, tofu
* Greek yogurt / curd / buttermilk
* Milk (toned / skim)
* Moong dal
* Green peas (moderate)
* Oats
* Vegetables (lauki, carrot, beans)
* Seeds (chia, flax, pumpkin)
* Lemon water (stone prevention)
* Adequate water (3–3.5 L/day)

---

### 🟡 **LIMITED FOODS (Portion-Controlled)**

* Chicken: **250 g × max 3 times/week**
* Fish: 1–2 times/week
* Chickpeas, rajma: small portions
* Peanuts: small handful
* Fruit: low-GI, limited quantity

---

### 🔴 **AVOID / RARE**

* Red meat
* Organ meat
* Bone broth
* Shellfish
* Sardines, anchovies
* High-dose whey protein
* Sugary drinks
* Alcohol
* Late-night heavy meals

---

## ⚠️ SPECIAL RULES (IMPORTANT FOR RETRIEVAL)

* **High animal protein + dehydration** → increases uric acid risk
* **Skipping dinner is OK**, but medicines must be taken with:

  * Curd / milk / light protein
* **Plant purines** (peas, dals) are safer than animal purines
* **B12 food alone is insufficient** → supplementation required with metformin
* **Early dinner (~6 pm)** improves sugar, gut, fatty liver
